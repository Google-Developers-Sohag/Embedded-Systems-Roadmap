# Introduction to embedded engineering: 

## Prologue:
Excel your embedded systems skills by building a good base. A good base starts from a good grasp of _the C programming language_, _general and digital electronics_, _boolean algebra_, _programmable devices_, and _programmable interfaces_. In addition, data structures, algorithms and design patterns, known collectively as software design and architecture, are useful adjuncts that will make a good embedded software engineer.
