# Introduction to embedded engineering: 

## Prologue:
Excel your embedded systems skills by building a good base. A good base starts from a good grasp of the C programming language, general and digital electronics, boolean algebra, programmable devices, and programmable interfaces. In addition, data structures, algorithms and design patterns, known collectively as software design and architecture, are useful adjuncts that will a good embedded software engineer.
